# In other practice problems, we have looked at how the
# scope of variables affects the modification of one
# "layer" when they are passed to another.

# To drive home the salient aspects of variable scope
# and modification of one scope by another, consider
# the following similar sets of code.

# What will be printed by each of these code groups?

# A)

def mess_with_vars(one, two, three)
  one = two # one #=> two, two #=> two
  two = three # one #=> two, two #=> three, three #=> three
  three = one # one #=> two, two #=> three, three #=> two
end

one = "one"
two = "two"
three = "three"

mess_with_vars(one, two, three)

puts "one is: #{one}" # "one"
puts "two is: #{two}" # "two"
puts "three is: #{three}" # "three"


# B)

def mess_with_vars(one, two, three)
  one = "two"
  two = "three"
  three = "one"
end

one = "one"
two = "two"
three = "three"

mess_with_vars(one, two, three)

puts "one is: #{one}" # "one"
puts "two is: #{two}" # "two"
puts "three is: #{three}" # "three"

# C)

def mess_with_vars(one, two, three)
  one.gsub!("one","two") # one #=> two
  two.gsub!("two","three") # two #=> three
  three.gsub!("three","one") # three #=> one
end

one = "one"
two = "two"
three = "three"

mess_with_vars(one, two, three)

puts "one is: #{one}" # two
puts "two is: #{two}" # three
puts "three is: #{three}" # one
